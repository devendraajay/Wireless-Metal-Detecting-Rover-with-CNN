The experimental evaluation of the Wireless Metal Detection Rover demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating a trained CNN model with embedded robotics and sensor-based navigation. During testing in an indoor environment, the rover was capable of accurately identifying a range of metal samples by capturing images through a downward-facing USB camera and classifying them using the deployed deep learning model.

The CNN model, trained on over 2000 labeled images across 16 distinct metal categories, delivered a moderate test accuracy of 54.23%. While predictions for classes like copper, iron, and lead showed high confidence and accuracy, misclassifications were observed in visually similar samples such as malachite and chrysocolla. These inaccuracies are attributed primarily to overlapping color and texture features in certain minerals, as well as image quality issues like shadows, blurriness, or inconsistent focus caused by movement of the rover and the USB camera's hardware limitations.

The classification performance further reflected the impact of data imbalance, where some classes had significantly fewer training images, leading to suboptimal generalization. Additionally, metals like aluminium and tin showed lower confidence predictions, which could be linked to their reflective surfaces and the effects of indoor lighting on image capture.

On the control side, the rover responded well to manual commands via the Flask web interface, with smooth directional movements and reliable obstacle detection using ultrasonic and IR sensors. The inclusion of a live video stream significantly aided in precise sample alignment during image capture. In semi-autonomous mode, the system was able to stop and reverse when encountering direct obstacles, showcasing functional sensor integration. However, full autonomy with path planning was not yet implemented, requiring the operator to control navigation manually.

Despite these limitations, the system successfully demonstrated real-time classification, obstacle-aware movement, and integration of computer vision with robotics in a low-cost prototype. The moderate model performance is considered acceptable at this stage, with substantial scope for improvement by increasing dataset diversity, enhancing camera quality, and optimizing lighting conditions.

The combined use of deep learning for metal classification and embedded hardware control proved to be a promising approach for practical mineral detection applications. With further enhancements in training data balance, CNN architecture optimization, and improved physical stability of the rover, the system has the potential to evolve into a fully autonomous and more accurate mineral exploration tool.
