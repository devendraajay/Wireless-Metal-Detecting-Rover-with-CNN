1. Metal Detection Techniques
Traditional metal detection methods primarily use Very Low Frequency (VLF) or Pulse Induction (PI) techniques. These rely on electromagnetic field disturbances to identify buried metallic objects. Although effective in simple environments, these methods face limitations when dealing with varied soil types, non-metallic obstacles, or low-conductivity minerals. Moreover, analog detectors lack automation and real-time classification capabilities.

Recent studies [1][2] have explored combining metal sensors with IoT modules for data logging and remote monitoring. However, these systems often lack intelligent classification, and the sensor data is not robust against false positives caused by environmental noise.
