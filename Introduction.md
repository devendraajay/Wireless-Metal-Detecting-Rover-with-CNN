# Introduction

Metal and mineral detection plays a critical role in areas such as mining, archaeology, environmental monitoring, and robotics. Traditional metal detectors rely on electromagnetic principles like pulse induction coils, which can be limited in precision, sensitive to noise, and ineffective at distinguishing between different types of metals or minerals.

To address these limitations, this project proposes a vision-based approach for wireless metal detection using a camera module and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is designed to capture real-time images using a downward-facing USB camera mounted on a mobile rover powered by a Raspberry Pi. These images are then analyzed using a pre-trained CNN model to classify the type of metal or mineral present beneath the camera.

The motivation behind this project is to create an intelligent and accurate metal detection system that can operate wirelessly and autonomously in unknown terrains. By replacing analog signals with digital vision-based classification, this system provides enhanced accuracy, greater flexibility, and the ability to identify a wide range of metallic and non-metallic objects.

The overall aim is to develop a low-cost, scalable solution that combines machine learning and embedded systems for real-world metal classification, logging, and exploration, making it highly useful for field applications where conventional sensors may fail or provide unreliable results.
