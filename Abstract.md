# Abstract

The Wireless Metal Detection  Rover project aims to identify and classify metallic and mineral objects in real-time using computer vision and deep learning. Traditional metal detectors often rely on analog sensors, which can be unreliable in complex or noisy environments. To overcome these limitations, this project leverages a USB camera mounted on a mobile rover and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to capture and analyze visual data of objects beneath the camera.

The camera continuously captures images as the rover moves across a surface. These images are then processed by a trained CNN model capable of recognizing and classifying various metallic substances such as iron, copper, gold, silver, and minerals like quartz or pyrite. The model was trained using a custom dataset containing labeled images of different minerals and metals under varied conditions.

This approach provides a flexible and accurate alternative to traditional metal detection systems, making it suitable for applications in geological surveys, mining, and educational robotics. The system is lightweight, deployable, and capable of operating in unknown terrains, with potential extensions including real-time mapping, and object localization.
