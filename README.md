# Wireless-Metal-Detecting-Rover-with-FFT-

The Wireless Metal Detecting Rover is a mobile robotic system designed to detect and analyze metal objects using a  metal detector. It is controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth and moves on a 4WD chassis motors and an L298N motor driver. FFT signal processing can be used to differentiate between metal types, making it useful for security, archaeology, and industrial applications
