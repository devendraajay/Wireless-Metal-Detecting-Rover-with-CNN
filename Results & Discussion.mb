 Results and Discussion
5.1 Experimental Setup
The Wireless Metal Detection Rover was tested in a controlled indoor environment with various metal samples placed on the ground. The rover was equipped with:

USB Camera (downward-facing) for image capture

Raspberry Pi 4 as the processing unit

Trained CNN model for metal classification

Motor drivers and sensors (IR, Ultrasonic) for mobility and obstacle detection

Flask Web Interface for remote control and image prediction

Each sample was classified using the "Capture & Predict" feature after aligning the rover above it. The performance of the system was evaluated based on classification accuracy, response time, and ease of control.

5.2 Sample Prediction Results
The system was tested with 16 different metal classes including copper, aluminium, silver, gold, iron, lead, etc. Below is a representative prediction:


Sample	True Label	Predicted Label	Confidence (%)
Aluminium Foil	Aluminium	Aluminium	16.73
Copper Plate	Copper	Copper	92.45
Iron Rod	Iron	Iron	88.90
Malachite Sample	Malachite	Chrysocolla	71.12
Lead Sheet	Lead	Lead	89.54
Note: In some cases, the model confused visually similar metals (e.g., malachite and chrysocolla) due to overlapping texture and color properties.

5.3 Model Performance
The final CNN model was trained using over 2000 labeled images with 16 metal categories. The overall performance on the test dataset is summarized below:


Metric	Value
Accuracy (Test Set)	54.23%
Loss (Cross Entropy)	1.21
Precision (Macro Avg.)	0.58
Recall (Macro Avg.)	0.56
F1 Score (Macro Avg.)	0.57
The accuracy is moderate, which is expected due to:

Visual similarity between some mineral classes

Blurred or shadowed images due to rover movement

Unbalanced training dataset

5.4 Rover Navigation and Control
The rover was able to:

Move forward, backward, turn left, and right smoothly using keyboard controls (W, A, S, D)

Stop when detecting obstacles using ultrasonic and IR sensors

Reverse automatically upon detecting an object directly ahead (if auto mode is enabled)

Stream live camera feed to the UI for accurate alignment and classification

5.5 Limitations Observed
Low Confidence Predictions: Some classes like aluminium and tin showed low prediction confidence due to reflectivity or lighting issues.

Camera Focus Variations: USB camera quality affected image sharpness.

Non-uniform Data Distribution: Some classes had fewer training images, affecting classification balance.

Manual Control Requirement: Navigation was manual; full autonomy is not yet implemented.

5.6 Summary
The system successfully demonstrated:

Live metal detection using a trained CNN model

Real-time rover control with object avoidance

Integration of robotics, camera, and ML-based classification in a working prototype

While the accuracy can be improved further with better datasets and camera calibration, the current implementation achieves the core goal of metal classification and rover-based exploration.
