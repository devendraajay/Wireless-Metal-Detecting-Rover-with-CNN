Future Work
While the current implementation achieves its core objectives, several enhancements can be considered for future improvements:

Autonomous Exploration and Mapping

Integrate path planning algorithms like A* or Dijkstra for fully autonomous exploration.

Add SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for dynamic map generation of detected minerals.

Model Optimization for Edge Devices

Convert the CNN model to TensorFlow Lite or ONNX for faster and more efficient on-board inference.

Apply quantization and pruning to reduce model size and inference latency.

Hardware Expansion

Add GPS and compass modules for outdoor geolocation tagging of detected minerals.

Upgrade to LiDAR or ToF sensors for better spatial awareness in uneven terrains.

Multi-Class and Hierarchical Classification

Improve classification performance using larger datasets, ensemble models, or attention-based CNNs.

Introduce confidence thresholds to reduce false positives and support human-in-the-loop review.

Wireless Communication & Data Sync

Integrate cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, AWS) to upload detected data in real-time.

Add SMS or email alerts when high-value minerals (e.g., gold, copper) are detected.

Deployment and Durability

Improve chassis design for outdoor rugged terrain.

Use waterproof casing for electronics and camera stabilization systems.
